The main objective of this exploratory data analysis project is to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize their product on the Play Store.

In this project of analyzing play store applications, we have worked on several parameters which would help AlmaBetter to do well in launching their apps on the play store.

• In the initial phase, we focused more on the problem statements and data cleaning, in order to ensure that we give them the best results out of our analysis. 

• AlmaBetter needs to focus more on : • Developing apps related to the least categories as they are not explored much. Like events and beauty. 

• Most of the apps are Free, so focusing on free app is more important. 

• Focusing more on content available for Everyone will increase the chances of getting the highest installs. 

• They need to focus on updating their apps regularly, so that it will attract more users. 

• They need to keep in mind that the sentiments of the user keep varying as they keep using the app, so they should focus more on users needs and features.
